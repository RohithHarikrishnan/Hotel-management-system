# Hotel-management-system
In many cases, a hotel management system is the first exposure future  guests will have of a hotel. It functions as the hotel’s welcome mat and  should be a pleasant experience for the user. A fully featured hotel  booking engine software will give the user the power to choose the  options they most want in an easy to use and intuitive format. Providing  these options also gives the hotel management a great opportunity to  upsell the customer with ancillary items. This is where having a  complete hotel hospitality management system comes in handy. By leveraging all of the data across your entire system, you’ll not only be able to present the potential guest with a more complete picture of your offerings, but you’ll also know how to make that offer more appealing to your guest. As, when all of the data collected about guest journeys are available in one place, algorithms will be able to help you identify ways to appeal to different guest-segments and vastly improve the ROI from your hotel booking system. Through this paper, we wish to offer our attempt at creating this integral part of a hotel’s system
